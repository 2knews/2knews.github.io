				2K League Teams
			</h2></a>
			When the 2K League initially kicked off in 2018 there was 17 teams in total. Since then, 8 teams has been added to the league roster. 22 of the 25 teams are affiliated with the Official NBA League, while the rest of the teams were created purely for the 2K League. Each team is composed of 5 players which are selected through a three round draft process.

				The 2K Draft
			</h2><p></a>
			The 2K Draft happens every single year in February. During the time each draft hopeful will see where their hard work from the previous months will land them. If a player performs well for a team in a previous season then that team is allowed to make that player a "protected player". This means that this player in no longer in the draft pool and will only play for that team. There will be forty seven total picks throughout three rounds and the team with the first overall pick is HawksTalon GC.

				Performance of the Week
			</h2><p></a>
			Each week, a player of the week will be selected based off of performance. Performance of the week is purely opinion based and it will go to the player who had benefited his team the most. All games played in the week, Sunday through Saturday, will be accounted for. It is not just the player who averages the highest stats but it is also who helped their team to victory. For example, if someone hits a half court they will be in a better position to win the award rather then someone who averaged 20 points a game but lost every game in the week.
